This is not really a generic function, it\u0027s something which very much knows about the structure of the returned data (e.g., it builds the if-name XPath keys a few lines below).\n\nThe other option would be redefining the \"leaf types\" of m_properties to something like variant\u003cstring, set\u003cstring\u003e\u003e, but that sounds a bit too complex for this tiny use case.\n\nSo I\u0027m fine with just removing that comment.",
